# Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking — Showcase

## Overview
This repository is a **demonstration hub** for my Master's research project on **Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP)** and **multi-vehicle coordination** in a simulated environment.  

It highlights **system capabilities, workflows, and test results** through videos, diagrams, and descriptive write-ups.  
> The **source code** for this work remains private, but this page provides a clear view of the project scope and achievements.

## Features Demonstrated
- **Distributed Multi-Vehicle Simulation** across multiple hosts using **ROS 2**, **Autoware**, **AWSIM Labs**, and **Zenoh**.
- **YOLOv5-Based Parking Spot Detection** from a Unity overhead camera feed.
- **Dynamic Goal Assignment & Conflict Resolution** between autonomous vehicles.
- **Scalable Architecture** tested with up to three vehicles.
- **Custom RViz Control Panel** for AVP testing and monitoring.
